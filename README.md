## About this account

This account contains these open repositories:
- **A series of projects `in action`**:  
  - [Spring Security with JWT in Action](https://github.com/aDudko/spring-security-with-jwt-in-action) - example of Spring Security implementation with JWT
  - [Spring Data with Liquibase in Action](https://github.com/aDudko/spring-data-with-liquibase-in-action) - example of Spring Data implementation with Liquibase
  - [Blockchain Banking in Action](https://github.com/aDudko/blockchain-banking-in-action) - example of blockchain technology on simple banking transactions
- [Blockchain Cryptocurrency](https://github.com/aDudko/blockchain-cryptocurrency) - the basic implementation of a blockchain and cryptocurrency application
- **Projects** for which I am happy to share a demo version (details with instructions on how to run it can be found in the repository itself), but I do not provide full access to the implementation, as I believe that the projects have excellent commercial potential, and I would not like them to be used without my knowledge.

  - **[Nebula](https://github.com/aDudko/nebula)** (in progress): a platform for data processing and analysis.
